# MVP Implementation Plan

## Day 1-3 (Core Framework and Essential Features) (Completed)
- **set up basics**
- initialize game with player
- enable movement through different settings of game
- add objects to game as well as dialog boxes that players can interact with
- add basic endings in pop-up window

## Day 4-5 (Add Story/scoring)
- use existing features to create a story that players can progress through (can but doesn't have to align with the actual book) (I added 3 more furnitures and made the walls a border so the player can't cross) `Milo Addition: added proles to interact with in the prole district, as well as making it so the player either ends up becoming a prole or a rebel`
- (Completed) or, (simpler option), implement some kind of scoring system in which players try to reach a high score before being captured
